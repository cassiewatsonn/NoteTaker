# NoteTaker

## Description

This Note Taker is built with Express.js that lets the user create a note with text. The user can create a new note, save notes, open previous notes and delete notes. As a University of Toronto Coding Bootcamp student, I want to be able to write, save and delete notes, so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

Once you have clicked 'Get Started' you will be brought to the main NoteTaker page where you will add, save, select and delete your notes! This page presents you with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column. When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. To delete a note, there is a red trash button to the right of your saved note that will delete your note!
